# TypeScript
- TypeScrit is a superset of JavaScript , which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. 

- TypeScript is a strongly typed language, which means that variables, function parameters, and function return types must have a data type associated with them.

example:
```typescript
let a: number = 10; // here we have to specify the data type of the variable 
let b: number = 20;
let c: number = a + b;
console.log(c);
```


- TypeScript is a compiled language, which means that it must be compiled into JavaScript before being executed in the browser.

- TypeScript is an object-oriented language, which means that it supports object-oriented programming features like classes, interfaces, polymorphism, data encapsulation, etc.

- TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means that the data type of a variable is known at compile time.

example:
```typescript
let a: number = 10;
a = "Hello"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
```
